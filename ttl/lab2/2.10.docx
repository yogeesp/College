The primeFactors(n, primes) function is a utility function that is used to store the 
prime factors of the number n in the list primes using dynamic programming. 
This function is called in the findPrimeFactors(n) function for every number from 2 to n.

The function starts by checking if the number n is divisible by any number from 2 to the
square root of n (inclusive) using a for loop. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, 
it means that n is not a prime number and its prime factors can be found by multiplying the
 prime factors of the divisor and the quotient.

The primes[n] = primes[i] + primes[n // i] line store the prime factors of the number 
n in the list by adding the prime factors of the divisor and the quotient.

If n is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n, then 
n is a prime number and its prime factor is just itself, so the code stores n in the 
list primes[n].

This way, we can use the prime factors of the number that we have already 
computed to find prime factors of the next number, thus avoiding redundant computations.

The function does not return anything as the prime factors are stored in the list primes.
